Hi, I'm Andy Newman (@Skwint), and I am based in the UK but not averse to moving around.

I'm a long time C++ developer (~30 years) with some recent experience in Java and Python.
At various points I've also used Ada, Fortran, Visual Basic, Objective-C and C# but I won't pretend those aren't a bit rusty right now.

I've used Qt more than any other GUI system, and use it by choice in my own projects when it's an option.

I have degrees in Physics and Electronics and have programmed Arm based systems from the ground up, as Arduino variants, and as mobile phones.
I may yet decide building robots is more fun than making games - we shall see.

I'm currently learning Godot, Quantum Mechanics and Art.
You can find me on the Godot discord if you want to chat.
If discord isn't your thing then you can email euclidsmouse at gmail for anything important.
